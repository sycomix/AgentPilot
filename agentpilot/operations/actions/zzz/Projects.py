Analyze the provided conversation and projects list and return any ID(s) that are contextually appropriate based on the given conversation.

Use the following conversation to guide your analysis. The last user message (denoted with arrows ">> ... <<") is the message you will use to determine the appropriate ID(s).

{conversation_str}

PROJECTS:
ID | project-type | project-name 
---------------------------------
{project_str}

Of these projects that the user is working on, return the ID of the one you think the latest user message is referencing. 
If there are multiple possible projects the user is referencing, then output them comma separated (eg. `2,5,6`)
If none of the projects from the list appear to be referenced on the last user message in the conversation, simply output "0". 
If none of the projects are referenced, but it is necessary to create a new project, then format the output like this: `0: {cat}: {{new-project-name}}`, replacing the placeholder with a brief, fitting name.
